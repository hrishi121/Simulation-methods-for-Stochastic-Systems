Question_1a.py
Write a routine to simulate a fair Bernoulli trial. 
Generate a histogram for 100 simulated Bernoulli trials.

Question_1b.py
Write a routine to count the number of successes in 7 fair Bernoulli trials.
Generate a histogram for 100 samples of this success-counting random variable.

Question_1c.py
Write a routine to count the longest run of heads in 100 Bernoulli samples. Generate a
histogram for this random variable.

Question_2.py
Take your Bernoulli success-counting random variable (the binomial random variable).
Generate and sum k=5 samples from this routine. Generate 300 such sums and 
histogram your results. Repeat for k = {10, 30, 50}. 
Comment on the histograms you observe for the different values of k.

Question_3.py
Given n=20 people in a social network. Imagine that any given unordered pair of two 
people are connected at random and independently with success probability p = 0.05.
• How many possible edges or connections, N, exist in a group of n = 20 people?
• Write a routine to select edges with probability p=0.05 out of the N candidate edges.
(think of the presence or absence of each distinct candidate edge as a Bernoulli trial)
• What is the distribution of the random number of edges selected in this way? 
Generate histograms to support your answer.
